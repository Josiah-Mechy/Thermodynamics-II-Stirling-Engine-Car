# Thermodynamics-II-Stirling-Engine-Car

## Overview
A small-scale **beta-type Stirling engine** powered vehicle built for Thermodynamics II. The car uses a mix of **3D-printed** and **off-the-shelf** components and demonstrates conversion of external heat into mechanical work. Included: SolidWorks models, photos, MATLAB analysis, and the final presentation.
